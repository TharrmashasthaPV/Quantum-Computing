# Quantum-Computing
Welcome to my Quantum Computing repository. 
This repository contains the qiskit codes for the quantum algorithms developed during my research work.

## Contents

### 1. [Autocorrelation](Autocorrelation/README.md)
This folder contains the qiskit code for autocorrelation sampling algorithm.

### 2. [Listing Linear Structures](Listing Linear Structures/README.md)
This folder contains the code for listing the epsilon-linear structures of a function for any given epsilon.
