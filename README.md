# Quantum-Computing
Welcome to my Quantum Computing repository. 
This repository contains the qiskit codes for the quantum algorithms developed during my research work.

## Contents

### 1. [Autocorrelation](Autocorrelation)
This folder contains the qiskit code for autocorrelation sampling algorithm.

### 2. [Listing-Linear-Structures](Listing-Linear-Structures)
This folder contains the code for listing the epsilon-linear structures of a Boolean function for any given epsilon.
